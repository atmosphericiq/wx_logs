# Project
wx_logs is a python package designed for processing large amounts of weather or climate data that comes in as point data. From there, we can do a lot of processing to it.  See README.md for more details.

# Running tests
To run tests, you can use python unittest

```py
python -m unittest tests
```

Or you can go to the specific file

# git preferences
- Never commit unless you get the user's permission
- Commit messages look like this: "[topic] description" and then any additional information below that line
- Topic should a be something useful, not just "feature" or "ui"


# style rules
- Always use 2 space indentation
- I prefer to close out } on same line instead of next line
- try to keep length max 80 columns but not a hard rule. always keep <120
- Put the comment for a function above the function using hash pound
